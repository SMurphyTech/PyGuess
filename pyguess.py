            Heya, Chris here. You know, the guy who developed this
            silly little game (You can see that in the copyright notice!).
            It's super lucky that you're actually seeing this! In fact, it's 
            a 1/100 chance! Take a picture!

            a lot that you took the time to not only get this working,
            but also played all the way through to One Billion!
